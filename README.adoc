This is a deployment of Prometheus with Alertmanager and Grafana.

The monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana) is deployed in its own project (app-mon).

The applications to be monitored are deployed in app-fuse.

== kubelet and cAdvicor and rbac
Those two are configured in prometheus-deployment.yaml and need
a specific clusterole-binding. You can find that in  prometheus-role.yaml.




== RBAC



== Pull secret
To pull images from registry.redhat.io you need to create a pull secret (redhat-pull-secret)
in the monitoring (app-mon) project.

You need this to pull the image (registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-oauth-proxy:latest).
