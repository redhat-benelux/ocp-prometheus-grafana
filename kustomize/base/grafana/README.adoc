This is work in progress

== Variable expansion
For now, it is using a Grafana v7.1+ because of ENV var expansion.

Only available in Grafana 7.1+.


== UserInfo
The OAuth server provided by OpenShift is an OAuth2 server.
If you need really the UserInfo then go for a complete OIDC implementation like Keycloak


== NAME_SPACE
The used namespace is set via env variables through the deployment.yaml.

== NAME_SPACE_ROUTE
That is the issuer for the OAuth server

[source]
----
  oc run --rm -i -t box --image=registry.redhat.io/ubi8-minimal --restart=Never -- curl https://openshift.default.svc/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
----

Returns a JSON file with the provided endpoints. Please use the field 'issuer' as NAME_SPACE_ROUTE


== Deploy

oc apply -k . -n probeer3


== Disable OAuth

Sometimes you need 'admin' access to Grafana
When you add
- -skip-auth-regex=^/
as the args to oauth-proxy
then oauth is disabled
